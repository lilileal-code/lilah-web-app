# [Product/Service Name] — Specification
 
> **How to use this template:** The specification is meant to be detailed before building anything and to represent the core "source of truth". It should be written for a non-technical author, but clear enough for an AI agent (or a team) to build from.
 
---
 
## 0. Constitution (fill once per project, reuse across specs)
 
Non-negotiable principles this product must never violate, regardless of feature.
 
| # | Principle | Why it exists |
|---|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | e.g. "Never store payment data ourselves" | Compliance risk |
| 2 | | |
| 3 | | |
 
---
 
## 1. Problem & Intent
 
**Who is this for?**
(Name the specific user, not "everyone.")
 
**What problem do they have today?**
(Describe the pain, not the solution.)
 
**Why now / why us?**
 
**What does success look like?**
(A measurable outcome, not a feature list — e.g. "80% of new users complete setup in under 3 minutes.")
 
---
 
## 2. Scope
 
**In scope** — what this version must do.
 
**Out of scope** — what it explicitly will NOT do (this list prevents scope creep and over-building).
 
---
 
## 3. User Scenarios
 
Write each as a short story: who, what they're trying to do, what "done" looks like.
 
**Scenario 1: [name]**
- Actor:
- Trigger:
- Steps:
- Success outcome:
- Failure outcome:

*(Repeat for each core scenario. 3–5 is typical for a first spec.)*

## 4. Requirements (EARS notation)
 
Use [EARS](https://alistairmavin.com/ears/) (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) so requirements are consistent and unambiguous.
 
Patterns:
- **Ubiquitous:** *The system shall [always do X].*
- **Event-driven:** *When [trigger], the system shall [response].*
- **State-driven:** *While [state], the system shall [response].*
- **Unwanted behavior:** *If [condition], then the system shall [response].*
- **Optional:** *Where [feature is present], the system shall [response].*

| ID | Requirement | Pattern |
|----|-------------|---------|
| R1 | When a user submits the signup form with a valid email, the system shall create an account and send a confirmation email. | Event |
| R2 | | |
 
---
 
## 5. Acceptance Criteria
 
For each requirement, define the test that proves it's done. If you can't write a pass/fail test, the requirement is still too vague.
 
| Requirement | Test | Pass condition |
|-------------|------|-----------------|
| R1 | Submit form with valid email | Account exists in DB; email received within 60s |
 
---
 
## 6. Constraints & Non-Functional Requirements
 
- **Performance:**
- **Security/Privacy:**
- **Accessibility:**
- **Compliance/Legal:**
- **Budget/Timeline:**
---
 
## 7. Open Questions
 
Anything unresolved. Don't let AI or a builder guess silently — list it and get an answer before build starts.
 
| Question | Owner | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| | | Open / Resolved |
 
---
 
## 8. Plan (derived from this spec — separate document once approved)
 
Once the spec above is approved, translate it into:
- **`plan.md`** — the approach and key decisions, each traced back to a requirement ID above
- **`tasks.md`** — atomic, ordered, checkable tasks derived from the plan
Do not skip from spec straight to a build without reviewing the plan first.
 
---
 
## 9. Approval
 
| Role | Name | Date | Signed off? |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| Spec owner | | | |
| Reviewer | | | |
